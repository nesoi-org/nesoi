# Nesoi Adapters

This folder should become multiple repos in the near future.
It contains the development of some adapters for my preferred technologies, however I believe these should not be mixed with the Nesoi core.

## @nesoi/postgres

A `BucketAdapter` which uses [Postgres.js](https://github.com/porsager/postgres) to manipulate a `PostgreSQL` database.

## @nesoi/express

A `ControllerAdapter` which uses [express](https://github.com/expressjs/express) to expose a Nesoi controller through an express application.
