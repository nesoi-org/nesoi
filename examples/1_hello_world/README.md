## Nesoi Examples: Hello World

This folder contains an example on how to use _Nesoi_ as a simple NPM library.

You can run it directly with `tsx`:

```
cd examples/1_hello_world
npx tsx main.ts
```

#### Performance Notice

Although this is possible, building the schemas might take some time.
If, for any reason, the project should build the schemas multiple times, you should consider bulding a full project with a LibraryRuntime.
